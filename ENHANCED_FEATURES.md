- Better accuracy for complex calculations
- Improved context understanding
- Higher quality design and drawing generation

### 4. Integrated Workflow

**Enhanced Process**:
```
Step 1: Integrated Project Definition
├── Discussion Thread (Scope, Components, Items)
├── Design Thread (Calculations, Specifications)
└── Drawing Thread (Technical drawings, Dimensions)

Step 2: Keywords & HSR Matching (uses all Step 1 outputs)
Step 3: Final Report Generation (integrates all data)
```

### 5. Advanced Data Management

**Features**:
- Conversation threading by mode
- Persistent storage of designs and drawings
- Project data organization
- Context optimization for token efficiency
