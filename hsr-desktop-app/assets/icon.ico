# This would be a binary ICO file for Windows
# For now, this is a placeholder - you would need to create an actual ICO file
# You can use tools like GIMP, Photoshop, or online converters to create an ICO file
# The icon should be 256x256 pixels with multiple sizes embedded (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256)
